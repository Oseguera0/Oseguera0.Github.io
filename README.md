        <p>Good morning City! today we went to the park!! it was full of awesome<br> stuff and thing's I did't even know existed! First, I don't know what to <br>type, beause this is such a fictional scenario. Second, I have some things<br> under my belt know that I really didn't have before. Lights out city, have<br> <em>a wonderful day!</em></p>

        <p>Today was definetinly not as good as yesterday. I literally stayed home all<br> day and now, I'm mildly depressed, but very peaceful. I dropped the ball<br> and kind of ruined my day. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about that.<br> I'm doing just fine everybody! So now remember, don't get sad, or caught<br> in the motions. And remember, above all these things, don't have a good<br> day City, have a <strong>great</strong> one! </p>
